[Unreleased]
Added
remove_personal_cap(campaign_id, contributor) public entrypoint exposing removal of a contributor's personal contribution cap, restoring the campaign-wide max_contribution_per_user as the only bound. Emits personal_cap_removed and returns PersonalCapNotFound when no cap is set (#503).
batch_save_campaigns(user, campaign_ids) public entrypoint that bookmarks several campaigns for a wallet in a single transaction with one auth check and storage write, reducing overhead for wallets managing multiple bookmarks at once; reverts atomically if any id fails.
clear_saved_campaigns(user) public entrypoint that resets a wallet's bookmark list in a single transaction, removing the need to call remove_saved_campaign once per id. Emits campaign_bookmarks_cleared.
get_saved_campaigns_count(user) public entrypoint returning just the number of a wallet's live bookmarks, so UI badges don't have to fetch and measure the full list.
get_saved_campaigns now returns only live bookmarks: campaigns that have been cancelled (or no longer exist) are filtered out, so clients no longer need a per-id lookup to tell a live bookmark from a stale one (#667).
Fixed
get_platform_stats now validates the relationship between the independently-stored platform counters (total_campaigns, active_campaigns, verified_campaigns, cancelled_campaigns) before reporting them. A partial migration or a failed legacy write can leave the counters mutually inconsistent; previously such corruption surfaced as impossible totals (e.g. more active campaigns than campaigns ever created) with stats_are_partial hardcoded to false. The query now checks the invariants (active, verified, cancelled each <= total, and active + cancelled <= total) and, on violation, returns the raw stored values with stats_are_partial = true and publishes a platform_stats_inconsistent audit event so indexers and dashboards know not to trust the aggregates until the counters are reconciled.

Reverted two accidental merges that shipped a broken duplicate ProofOfHeartContract contract (a stray list_active_campaigns(tag_filter), category max-goal cap functions, and a remove_personal_cap impl referencing non-existent storage keys), plus orphaned TypeScript SDK files and stray frontend React files with no build setup. The real ProofOfHeart contract is now the only contract in the crate.

Removed
Removed the dead BlockContributionCount storage key variant and its unused get_block_contribution_count / set_block_contribution_count helpers. Only the per-campaign BlockCampaignContributionCount is actually used by the anomaly-detection burst guard (#435).
Fixed
verify_campaigns (batch admin verification) now returns (verified_ids, failed_ids) covering every id it processed, instead of collapsing a partial-success batch into Err(first_error). Callers can now distinguish partial success from total failure and retry only the failed ids, and the successful verifications are committed on-chain instead of being reverted; the campaigns_bulk_verified event payload is now (verified_count, failed_ids) (#442).

resume_campaign now checks the global AutoPaused flag before require_active_campaign, returning early with ValidationFailed when the contract is not auto-paused instead of failing on an unrelated campaign-state check. The admin recovery path via unpause() also clears AutoPaused alongside Paused so neither flag can permanently lock the contract (#436).

cancel_campaign now rejects with GoalMetCancellationNotAllowed when amount_raised >= funding_goal and funds have not yet been withdrawn, preventing rug-pull-adjacent behaviour where a creator could cancel after reaching the goal and force all contributors to self-serve refunds (#164).

update_campaign_description now blocks edits once amount_raised > 0, preventing bait-and-switch after contributions (#166).

claim_creator_revenue returns ValidationFailed when revenue_share_percentage > 10000 instead of producing negative math or panicking (#167).

init and update_platform_fee now reject platform_fee values above 1000 with InvalidPlatformFee instead of silently capping them.

initiate_campaign_transfer now rejects cancelled or withdrawn campaigns, keeping ownership transfers off terminal campaigns (#323).

resume_campaign now returns ValidationFailed when no pause is active, preventing spurious state writes and campaign_resumed events (#348).

update_campaign now emits both the updated title and description in campaign_updated, allowing full metadata indexing without extra reads (#349).

Infrastructure
fuzz.yml now discovers fuzz targets via cargo fuzz list and runs all of them instead of hardcoding fuzz_contribute, so newly added targets are picked up automatically (#770).
Added a fuzz_revenue.rs fuzz target covering the percentage-based revenue split arithmetic in revenue.rs's deposit/claim paths (#773).
Added a fuzz_lifecycle.rs fuzz target driving arbitrary sequences of lifecycle-changing calls (contribute, verify, cancel, withdraw) against lifecycle::transition's state-machine guard (#772).
Added a fuzz_voting.rs fuzz target covering vote-casting and the quorum/approval-threshold arithmetic in voting.rs (#771).
ci.yml now caches the cargo registry and target directory (Swatinem/rust-cache) across the basic, audit, and wasm-size jobs, cutting redundant from-scratch dependency compiles on every run (#762).
Restored a cargo audit job in ci.yml, scanning the dependency tree (including the vendored ethnum patch) for known vulnerabilities on every push and PR, with the same RUSTSEC-2024-0344/RUSTSEC-2026-0009 ignores documented in 
CONTRIBUTING.md
 (#763).
Added a wasm-size job to ci.yml that builds the release WASM target and fails if it grows more than 5% past the recorded baseline in 
wasm-size-baseline.txt
, catching unexpected binary bloat before merge (#765).
Added a 
Makefile
 with a build-docker target utilizing the stellar/rs-soroban-sdk image to guarantee WASM binary reproducibility, allowing anyone to verify that the deployed on-chain bytecode matches the source (#533).
Resolved pre-existing CI debt surfaced by the fmt and clippy gates added in #403: test fixture missing bindings restored in src/test.rs and src/tests/test_init.rs, result double-move fixed in 
test_admin.rs
, cargo fmt --all drift cleared across src/issues_test.rs and 
lib.rs
, and clippy lints addressed (manual_div_ceil in 
lib.rs
; dead_code suppressed on deferred storage helpers pending the DataKey audit in #409). All three CI jobs (test, fmt, clippy) now exit 0 on a clean checkout (#418).
Refactored
Extracted assert_admin(env, caller) helper; used in pause, unpause, and set_voting_params to provide a single source of truth for admin authorization (#224).
Documentation
Clarified the ## Changelog section of 
CONTRIBUTING.md
: documented the project-specific categories used alongside Keep a Changelog (Removed, Security, Infrastructure, Documentation), and spelled out where and when to add an entry (#764).
Added 
CHANGELOG.md
 and documented the Keep-a-Changelog convention in 
CONTRIBUTING.md
 (#227).
